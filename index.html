  <p>Wireguard: when your client and server use the same subnet</p>

<a href="https://www.wireguard.com">Wireguard</a> is a simple fast and secure
VPN. An easy way to use it is with
<a
  href="https://manpages.debian.org/unstable/wireguard-tools/wg-quick.8.en.html"
  >wg-quick</a
>. But wireguard doesn't work out of the box if your client and server both use
the same subnet.
<p></p>
<p>
  Here's my scenario. My laptop runs Ubuntu. Often, when I'm away from home it
  is using a 10.0.0.0/24 subnet. My server is at home at also uses the subnet
  10.0.0.0/24. The server is setup to do forwarding so I can access other
  machines on my home network. When I use the configuration file below on my
  laptop, any attempt to access my home machines results in trying to access the
  local subnet. Now, if my laptop was instead using a 192.168.0.0/24 subnet,
  things would work. But I don't assign that address, dhcp does.
</p>
<p>
  The solution I propose results in all traffic on the laptop being sent through
  the wireguard interface. So you won't be able to access any other devices,
  such as a printer, connected to your laptop local subnet.
</p>
<p>
  Notice my laptop wg0 is configured with IP address 10.1.0.3. My home wireguard
  interface has the address 10.1.0.1. This means the wireguard interfaces are
  not confused with my laptop or home addresses.
</p>
<p></p>
<b>wg0.conf</b>
<pre class="indent">
[INTERFACE]
address=10.1.0.3/16
PrivateKey = &lt;private>
DNS = 10.0.0.1
ListenPort = 51821

[peer]

AllowedIPs = 0.0.0.0/0
</pre>
<p>
  <b># wg-quick up wg0</b>

[#] sysctl -q net.ipv4.conf.all.src_valid_mark=1
[#] nft -f /dev/fd/63
</pre>

<p>
  Let's figure out what's going wrong. Here's the output from the ip command for
  rules and tables.
</p>

<b># ip rule</b>
<pre class="indent">
0:      from all lookup local
32764:  from all lookup main suppress_prefixlength 0
32765:  not from all fwmark 0xca6c lookup 51820
32766:  from all lookup main
32767:  from all lookup default
</pre>

<b># ip route show table 51820</b>
<pre class="indent">
default dev wg0 scope link
</pre>
<b># ip route show table main</b>
<pre class="indent">
default via 10.0.0.1 dev wlp2s0 proto dhcp metric 600
10.0.0.0/24 dev wlp2s0 proto kernel scope link src 10.0.0.195 metric 600
10.1.0.0/16 dev wg0 proto kernel scope link src 10.1.0.3
169.254.0.0/16 dev wlp2s0 scope link metric 1000
</pre>
<p>
  Let's say I'm trying to reach a home machine at 10.0.0.14. When a packet is
  sent from an application on the laptop, the rules will be checked one after
  the other. We can ignore rule 0. It is used to check for local loopback. Then
  comes rule
  <i>32764: from all lookup main suppress_prefixlength 0</i>. This rule says,
  check the main table, but ignore the default route. The odd syntax
  <i>suppress_prefixlength 0</i> Represents the address 0.0.0.0, which is for
  the default entry. Just like 1.2.3.4/8 means 1.0.0.0. Everything after the
  first eight bits is set to zero. /0 is an extreme case which sets all bits to
  zero. This gives the main table the opportunity to route packets if they do
  not end up using the default route. If the default route would have been used,
  since it is suppressed, we just return from the table and move on to the next
  rule.
</p>
<p>
  And this is where our problem occurs. If I'm trying to contact my home
  10.0.0.14 address, the main table will match it on the second line:
  <i>10.0.0.0/24 dev wlp2s0 proto kernel scope link src 10.0.0.195 metric 600</i
  >. And send it out through my wireless interface, wlp2s0. It never made it
  through wg0. Now, if my laptop had a 192.168.0.0/24 subnet, only the default
  entry would have matched, and since it was suppressed, nothing would happen.
  I'll show you how to fix this later on. Let's continue on with rule evaluation
  as if a problem didn't occur.
</p>
<p>
  The next rule <i>32765: not from all fwmark 0xca6c lookup 51820</i> is very
  interesting. This says any packet which doesn't have the mark 0xca6c (51820)
  should use table 51820. The 51820 table simply sends every packet through wg0.
  This is what we want to happen, send everything through wg0. Now what is this
  fwmark? Did you notice the following command from the output of the wg-quick
  command?
</p>
<p class="indent">wg set wg0 fwmark 51820</p>
<p>
  This tells the wireguard interface to mark every packet it encrypts with the
  mark 51820. This mark is not inserted into the packet that will be sent over
  the internet. The kernel simply remembers this packet has a mark. A mark is
  something routing rules can check. This mark lets us know if wg0 has processed
  the packet. If it hasn't then send it through wg0. If it is marked, we just
  move to the next rule.
</p>
<p>
  And finally, if the packet isn't yet encrypted, we fall through to the next
  rule <i>32766: from all lookup main</i>. This just applies all the normal
  routing rules, including the default route, which existed before wg0 was
  brought up. This is a very clever scheme. Since the main table is left intact,
  it's easy for encrypted packets to be sent onto the network through the
  wireless interface without wg0 getting in the way, and without endless loops
  of attempting to encrypt an already encrypted packet. It also means if the pre
  wireguard routing rules were complex, they remain intact. There is no need for
  wg-quick to duplicate rules, or do complex analysis on the existing rules to
  see how they should be modified.
</p>
<h2>The fix</h2>
<p>
  Our problem was caused by the rule
  <i>32764: from all lookup main suppress_prefixlength 0</i>. That rule caused
  what it thought were clearly local addresses to go out the wireless lan. The
  fix is to delete this rule. We do this by modifying wg0.conf, and adding one
  line to be executed after the interface has been brought up.
</p>
